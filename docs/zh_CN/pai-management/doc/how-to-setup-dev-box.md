## What's dev-box? <a name="introduce"></a>

Dev-Box is a docker container which contains necessary dependent software for paictl to deploy and manage you cluster. With a dev-box, you no longer need to install the software in your host environment, make your host environment's software package clean.

## Install docker on your server <a name="c-step-1"></a>

    dev-box is a docker container used to boot up or/and maintain a PAI cluster. For convenience, we provide a prebuild Docker image on Docker Hub.

### Use prebuild dev-box image <a name="c-step-1.1"></a>

Notice that `dev-box` should run on a machine outside of PAI cluster, it shouldn't run on any PAI cluster node. **replace below v0.x.y to latest release, which can be found [here](https://github.com/Microsoft/pai/releases). For example: v0.9.5**

```bash
<br /># Pull the dev-box image from Docker Hub
sudo docker pull docker.io/openpai/dev-box:v0.x.y

# Run your dev-box
# Assume the path of custom-hadoop-binary-path in your service-configuration is /pathHadoop,
#   and the path of your cluster-configuration is /pathConfiguration.
# By now, you can leave it as it is, we only mount those two directories into docker container for later usage.
sudo docker run -itd \
        -e COLUMNS=$COLUMNS -e LINES=$LINES -e TERM=$TERM \
        -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock \
        -v /pathConfiguration:/cluster-configuration  \
        -v /hadoop-binary:/hadoop-binary  \
        --pid=host \
        --privileged=true \
        --net=host \
        --name=dev-box \
        docker.io/openpai/dev-box:v0.x.y

# Working in your dev-box
sudo docker exec -it dev-box /bin/bash
cd /pai

# Now you are free to configure your cluster and run PAI commands...

```

### build dev-box docker image on your own <a name="c-step-1.2"></a>

#### Build dev-box on the latest code

**Notice**, replace v0.x.y as above, if you are trying to deploy OpenPAI. You can also remove -b parameter, if you are contributing to latest OpenPAI, but it's unstable.

```bash
<br /># if you are trying to install latest release, replace v0.x.y like to v0.9.5. If you are trying to contribute on OpenPAI, you can remove -b parameter and clone to default branch.
git clone -b v0.x.y https://github.com/Microsoft/pai.git

# Go into the workdir.
cd pai/src/dev-box/

# Build your dev-box.
sudo docker build -t dev-box . --file=build/dev-box.dockerfile

```

#### Start your dev-box container

- Suppose the directory path of your cluster-configuration is `/pathConfiguration`. Note: Don't change the configuration file nameÔºÅ

```bash
<br /># Run your dev-box
sudo docker run -itd \
        -e COLUMNS=$COLUMNS -e LINES=$LINES -e TERM=$TERM \
        -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock \
        -v /pathConfiguration:/cluster-configuration  \
        -v /hadoop-binary:/hadoop-binary  \
        --pid=host \
        --privileged=true \
        --net=host \
        --name=dev-box \
        dev-box

# Working in your dev-box
sudo docker exec -it dev-box /bin/bash
cd /pai

# Now you are free to configure your cluster and run PAI commands...

```

## Deploy dev-box over existing K8s <a name="c-step-2"></a>

If you want to deploy dev-box in already deployed kubernetes.

Prerequisites: The user has installed kubectl on the current machine.

(1) Create a label for the server to be deployed:

```bash
kubectl label --overwrite=true nodes $NODE-IP-ADDRESS dev-box=true
```

(2) Deploy dev-box to kubernetes

```bash
cd pai/src/dev-box

kubectl create -f dev-box-k8s-deploy.yaml
```
