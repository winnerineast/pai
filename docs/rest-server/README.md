# REST Server

## Goal

REST Server exposes a set of interface that allows you to manage jobs.

## Architecture

REST Server is a Node.js API service for PAI that deliver client requests to different upstream
services, including [FrameworkLauncher](../frameworklauncher/README.md), Apache Hadoop YARN, WebHDFS and
etcd, with some request transformation.

## Dependencies

To start a REST Server service, the following services should be ready and correctly configured.

* [FrameworkLauncher](../frameworklauncher/README.md)
* Apache Hadoop YARN
* HDFS
* etcd

## Build

Run `yarn install` to install dependencies.

## Configuration

If REST Server is deployed by [pai management tool][pai-management], configuration is located in
`restserver` block of [service configuration][service-configuration] file, including:

* `server-port`: Integer. The network port to access the web portal. The default value is 9186.
* `jwt-secret`: A random secret token for user authorization, keep it secret to users.
* `jwt-expire-time`: String that repesents a timespan eg: "1d", "20h".
* `default-pai-admin-username`: The username of default user. REST Server will auto generate it
  after the first start of service.
* `default-pai-admin-password`: The password of default user.

---

If REST Server is deployed manually, the following fields should be configured as environment
variables:

* `LAUNCHER_WEBSERVICE_URI`: URI endpoint of [Framework Launcher](../frameworklauncher/README.md)
* `HDFS_URI`: URI endpoint of HDFS
* `WEBHDFS_URI`: URI endpoint of WebHDFS
* `YARN_URI`: URI endpoint of Apache Hadoop YARN
* `ETCD_URI`: URI endpoints of ectd, could be multiple and separated by comma(`,`)
* `LOG_MANAGER_PORT`: The port of log manager.
* `JWT_SECRET`: A random secret token for user authorization, keep it secret to users.
* `DEFAULT_PAI_ADMIN_USERNAME`: The username of default user. REST Server will auto generate it
  after the first start of service.
* `DEFAULT_PAI_ADMIN_PASSWORD`: The password of default user.

And the following field could be configured optionally:

* `LOG_LEVEL`: The log level of the service, default value is `debug`, could be
    * `error`
    * `warn`
    * `info`
    * `debug`
    * `silly`
* `SERVER_PORT`: The network port to access the web portal. The default value is 9186.

## Deployment

The deployment of REST Server goes with the bootstrapping process of the whole PAI cluster, which is described in detail in [Tutorial: Booting up the cluster](../pai-management/doc/customized-configuration.md).

---

If REST Server is need to be deployed as a standalone service, follow these steps:

1. Go into `rest-server` directory
2. Run `npm start`

## Upgrading

REST Server is a stateless service, so it could be upgraded without any extra operation.

## Service Metrics

TBD

## Service Monitoring

TBD

## High Availability

REST Server is a stateless service, so it could be extends for high availability without any extra operation.

## Runtime Requirements

To run REST Server on system, a [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) 6+ runtime is required, with [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) installed.

## API document

Read [API document](./API.md) for the details of REST API.

## FAQ

> Q: What is the default username and password?
>
> A: Default username and password is configured in
>  - `DEFAULT_PAI_ADMIN_USERNAME` and `DEFAULT_PAI_ADMIN_PASSWORD` environment variables
>    if service is deployed manually.
>  - `restserver.default-pai-admin-username` and `restserver.default-pai-admin-password` field
>    in [service configuration file][service-configuration]
>    if service is deployed by [pai management tool][pai-management].

> Q: Why can't I login with default username and password?
>
> A: If there is already a `/users` directory in etcd, REST Server will not auto generate
>    the default user, even it is empty and without any users. To regenerate default user,
>    try [delete the whole `/users` directory](https://coreos.com/etcd/docs/latest/v2/api.html#deleting-a-directory)
>    and restart REST Server, a new default user will be generated.
